## Edge Computing Revolution

Computing power moves closer to the data source:

```javascript
// Example: Edge computing for IoT devices
const processDataAtEdge = (sensorData) => {
  // Process data locally before sending to cloud
  const filtered = filterNoise(sensorData);
  const aggregated = aggregateReadings(filtered);
  
  // Only send processed data to cloud
  if (aggregated.requiresCloudProcessing) {
    sendToCloud(aggregated);
  }
  
  return localResponse(aggregated);
};
```
